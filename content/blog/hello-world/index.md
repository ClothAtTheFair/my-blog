If the title didn't give it completely away, this is my first blog post on my new blog!
Writing once a week (either Saturday or Sunday) giving a quick recap of what I've done over the week
and any essential learning points.

Before getting deep into this journey, it might be helpful if I give a little background about myself. 
In university, I started as a computer science major but after an internship and some higher level classes (admittedly before I should have), I switched my major to eventually Mechanical Engineering. The thought was that I wanted to be a more hands on engineer even possibly in roller coasters and I viewed computer science as either creating video games or fixing bugs all day like a previous internship.
In hindsight, I should have done more research and learned that there are more options than that internship I was given but I was 
19 at the time and I have a flaw of making rash decisions. 

It wasn't until the end of last summer I got into data analytics this summer I realized I enjoyed higher math and programming again so I started to look to data science.
