Before I go into this blog post I would first like to say hello and thank you for stopping by. I know I'm not the only blog you will see out in the webs so I'm glad you chose to stop by
During college I spend time not only doing engineering classes but I spent some time working as a frontend developer for an internship and a part time job at USC. During this time I learned quite a bit about front end development and thought about making a website but didn't have the time to finish it. With the time now from graduating, I have set some time each night after work to continue and create a stable version of my personal website.
This blog will talk about my progress becoming a robotic engineer, things about graduate school and technical reports, things I learn about web development, and other topics such as life lessons with randomness sprinkled in. While some of the advice may only pertain to robotic engineering or engineering in general, (some in FRC as I mentor a team) some will be more general.
The idea is to post 3 times a week after work on some topics I already have in mind but I'm always open to suggestions (bradleybsf@gmail.com). Would you kindly join me on this adventure?
