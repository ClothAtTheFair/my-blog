While this blog comes before the one about redoing my website into a react application with multiple pages, the process actually started before it. 

On a very long list of books I would love to read if I have the time, <a href = "https://mostly-adequate.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/">Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming </a> seemed to stand out as one I should start now. With a little over a month left before I start computer science grad school, it would make sense to understand both the basics of object oriented programming as well as functional programming. 

The book guides you through functional programming using Javascript examples with exercises to practice what was just learned. The first few chapters are an overview which I found easy enough to comprehend. But chapter 4 started the concepts that leverage functional programming (currying to start) which take a bit for me to understand. 

I'm not sure if I was overcomplicating the solutions in my head or my past experience with functions needing the exact number of arguements that made this hard to grasp but after rereading a few times I think I got it. Besides the book, <a href = "https://blog.bitsrc.io/understanding-currying-in-javascript-ceb2188c339"> this post </a> helped to piece the concept of currying in my mind.

While this upcoming week will be chaotic with Thanksgiving and the Clemson/Carolina football game, I am hoping I can go through another chapter and maybe even work on my personal <a href = "https://personal-website-bl2h3u7r9.now.sh/"> website </a>.

Thanks for reading and I'll talk to you again soon!
