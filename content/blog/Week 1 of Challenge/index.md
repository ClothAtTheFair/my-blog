Where to begin?

In case I didn't mention this on here already, my goal for 2020 is to work on at least 6 software projects in 12 months. I will also try to compete in coding competitions that I have the time for and continue to mentor a FRC robotics team (my life will be hectic but in a good way). The first project is to create a single page developer portfolio in ReactJS complete with functional and unit tests. There will also be some easter eggs added in to make it a unique build. :)

My approach is to create it in an agile manner with Minimal Viable Products and iterations. The testing will be a mix of Test Driven Development and tests created after implementation to make sure nothing is missed. 

So far I have used React Routers to achieve a single page website and have learned how to test this functionality. This was accomplished using the <a href = "https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro" target="_blank">React testing library</a> mocking the router. This way of testing is somewhat similar to the tests I have done in C# but I learned I need to read and practice a lot more of JS testing if I want accurate tests that pass!

I have also added in buttons for my social media on the home page and created a basic contact form but only the front end. There have been some issues with the backend that is partly due to the application not being hosted as of yet. 

If I can takeaway anything from the project so far, it is to look for the simple solution first. I have been testing out different ways to implement cards and my first idea was to do this with JS. While that works, it looked to be quite a bit as there was still html and css needed. Then I looked a bit more and realized it can be done with just html and css in a much easier way. I need to remember that this project isn't to test my skill in JS but web development in general. That and always look for a simple solution to save myself the headache!


Thanks for taking the time to read this and I will see you on the flip side!
