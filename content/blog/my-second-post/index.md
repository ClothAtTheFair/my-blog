title: Progress? Slowly

When I started my journey early September, I had big dreams of learning data science within 3 months. However, I didn't really think about the fact that
I just started to transition into a full time job with a project that requires blended hours to work internationally. Along with that, most of the project involves software development using new software that I hadn't quite learned yet and so I would come home to get up to speed quickly. 

So while I haven't been following the path I planned exactly, I have learned quite a bit of core software development that will help me in my future. 
I have now realised 3 months with a full time engineering job may have been a little agressive so instead I am working towards a better understanding in 6 months time. I am still going to try and follow this guide (https://github.com/llSourcell/Learn_Data_Science_in_3_Months) and complete https://www.coursera.org/ courses but at a much slower pace for me to fully grasp it than mentioned in the guide.

So far I've looked at an overview of data science and started a course on R programming a few weeks ago which I will be starting up again this week, I had a big push at work so I came home tired most days. Let's hope for the best!
